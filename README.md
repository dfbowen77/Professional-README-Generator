# Professional-README-Generator
This repo represents my submission for the module 9 challenge to make a professional README generator. 

## Description
The following webpage is designed to meet the requirements of the Module 9 Challenge. It represents the beginnings of a README Generator. Users input the name of their project, a project description, installation instructions, usage instructions, guidelines for contributing, instructions for running tests, a project license, a github username, and an email address, all via the command line. The resulting README file that is generated contains links to various sections within the document as well as links to ways the author can be contacted.      

## Demo
